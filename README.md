# Emergency-and-Non-Emergency-vehicle-Detection
Welcome to the Emergency Vehicle Classifier project! This repository implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of vehicles as either emergency or non-emergency. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images, and it employs data augmentation techniques to enhance its performance. To get started, clone the repository, install the required packages, and use the provided scripts to train the model and make predictions. The model's architecture, dataset organization, and usage instructions are detailed in the README. Contributions are encouraged, and the project is licensed under the MIT License. Let's collaborate and enhance this classifier to accurately identify emergency vehicles.
