This project presents an Emergency Vehicle Classifier developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras. The classifier aims to differentiate between emergency and non-emergency vehicles by analyzing input images. Leveraging a dataset of labeled vehicle images, the CNN model is trained and employs data augmentation techniques to enhance its ability to generalize to real-world scenarios. The trained model's accuracy on a test dataset is approximately x%, and the results, including the confusion matrix and classification report, are available in the results directory. The model's architecture, consisting of convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers, can be tailored to specific requirements. The project provides clear instructions for installation, training, and prediction, offering the flexibility to adapt it to new datasets and contribute enhancements. The project is licensed under the MIT License, and contributions are encouraged through pull requests.
